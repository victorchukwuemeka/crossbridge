### **Project Name:** **CrossBridge**  
### **Description:**  
CrossBridge is a **Solana-to-Ethereum asset bridge** that allows users to seamlessly move **SOL** from the Solana blockchain to **Ethereum**, where it is represented as **wrapped SOL (wSOL)**. Users can then trade **wSOL for ETH** on Ethereum-based decentralized exchanges like **Uniswap** or **Curve**. The bridge also allows users to **redeem wSOL** back into **SOL on Solana** at any time.

### **ðŸ”§ Key Features:**  
âœ… **Solana to Ethereum bridging** â€“ Lock SOL on Solana and mint wSOL on Ethereum.  
âœ… **Ethereum to Solana bridging** â€“ Burn wSOL on Ethereum and unlock SOL on Solana.  
âœ… **Swap wSOL to ETH** â€“ Users can trade wSOL for ETH via Uniswap.  
âœ… **Rust-based relayer bot** â€“ Automates cross-chain transactions.  
âœ… **Smart contract security** â€“ Prevents exploits and ensures secure transfers.

Here's a **step-by-step design and action plan** for your **CrossBridge** project that bridges **SOL** from **Solana** to **Ethereum** as **wSOL**.

---

### **ðŸŒ‰ Project Design**

The goal is to create a cross-chain bridge that lets users lock **SOL** on Solana, receive **wSOL** on Ethereum, and also reverse the process. The design will involve 4 main components:

1. **Solana Program (Solana Side)**  
   - Locks SOL and emits events.
   - Unlocks SOL when wSOL is burned on Ethereum.

2. **Ethereum Smart Contract (Ethereum Side)**  
   - Receives wSOL and mints it.
   - Burns wSOL and sends a signal to unlock SOL on Solana.

3. **Relayer Bot**  
   - Listens to events on both Solana and Ethereum.
   - Executes cross-chain actions: locking/unlocking SOL and minting/burning wSOL.

4. **Frontend Interface (Optional)**  
   - Allows users to interact with the bridge.
   - Displays balance, history, and status of their transactions.

---

### **1. Solana Program (Bridge Program)**

#### **Actions:**
1. **Initialize the Bridge Account**  
   This will create a **bridge account** on Solana to store locked SOL.

   **Instruction:**  
   - `initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>)`: Initializes the bridge account.

2. **Lock SOL**  
   - The user locks SOL by sending it to the **bridge account** on Solana.
   - The program emits a **LockEvent** with the userâ€™s public key, the amount locked, and the timestamp.
   - **Update `total_locked`**: Increment the total amount of SOL locked in the bridge account.

   **Instruction:**  
   - `lock_sol(ctx: Context<LockSol>, amount: u64)`: Lock the SOL and emit the event.

3. **Unlock SOL**  
   This is triggered by the **relayer bot** when wSOL is burned on Ethereum.
   - Transfer the **locked SOL** from the bridge account back to the user.

   **Instruction:**  
   - `unlock_sol(ctx: Context<UnlockSol>, amount: u64)`: Unlock SOL after receiving the burn event.

---

### **2. Ethereum Smart Contract (ERC20 wSOL)**

#### **Actions:**
1. **Mint wSOL**  
   - The contract mints **wSOL** when it receives the **LockEvent** from Solana.
   - The amount of wSOL corresponds to the amount of SOL locked.

2. **Burn wSOL**  
   - The contract burns **wSOL** when a user requests to unlock their SOL back on Solana.
   - Triggers a call to the **Solana program** to unlock the SOL.

#### **Steps:**
1. **Create ERC20 contract** for **wSOL** with minting and burning functionality.
   - Use **OpenZeppelin**â€™s ERC20 implementation.
   - Mint wSOL when the **LockEvent** is relayed.
   - Burn wSOL when users want to unlock SOL.

2. **Security Measures**:  
   - Ensure only authorized relayers can trigger minting and burning actions.
   - Implement ownership/access control mechanisms (e.g., using `Ownable` or `AccessControl`).

---

### **3. Relayer Bot (Rust-Based)**

#### **Actions:**
1. **Listen for Lock Events on Solana**  
   - The bot listens to the **LockEvent** emitted by the Solana program.
   - When a `LockEvent` is detected, it triggers the minting of **wSOL** on Ethereum.

2. **Listen for Burn Events on Ethereum**  
   - The bot listens for the burn event from the **Ethereum contract**.
   - When wSOL is burned on Ethereum, it calls the **Solana program** to unlock the corresponding SOL.

3. **Cross-Chain Actions**  
   - The bot monitors and facilitates the cross-chain interactions. This bot acts as the bridge between Ethereum and Solana, making sure everything is synchronized.

#### **Bot Steps:**
1. **Solana Listener:**
   - Use **Anchor**'s event API to listen for `LockEvent`.
   - On receiving the event, call Ethereum's contract to mint wSOL.

2. **Ethereum Listener:**
   - Listen for the burn event from the wSOL contract.
   - Once detected, send a transaction to the Solana program to unlock SOL.

3. **Error Handling & Security**:
   - Ensure the bot is secure and only processes legitimate transactions.
   - Include retries or backoff strategies in case transactions fail.

---

### **4. Frontend Interface (Optional)**

#### **Actions:**
1. **Allow users to lock and mint wSOL**  
   - Users can send SOL to the bridge account via the Solana program.
   - After the transfer, users will see their **wSOL** balance on Ethereum.

2. **Allow users to burn wSOL and unlock SOL**  
   - Users can burn their wSOL on Ethereum to trigger the unlocking of SOL on Solana.

3. **Wallet Integration**  
   - Integrate wallets such as **Phantom** (Solana) and **MetaMask** (Ethereum).

4. **Display Transaction Status and History**  
   - Users can track the status of their lock/unlock transactions.

---

### **Step-by-Step Action Plan**

#### **Step 1: Develop Solana Program**
- **Action:** Write and deploy the `initialize`, `lock_sol`, and `unlock_sol` instructions in Solana using Anchor.

#### **Step 2: Develop Ethereum Smart Contract**
- **Action:** Write the ERC20 contract for **wSOL**, and implement minting and burning.
- **Action:** Deploy the contract on Ethereum (using Remix or Hardhat).

#### **Step 3: Develop Relayer Bot**
- **Action:** Write the Rust-based bot to listen for Solana events and Ethereum events.
- **Action:** Implement cross-chain logic to handle minting and burning of wSOL.

#### **Step 4: Develop Frontend (Optional)**
- **Action:** Write a frontend (e.g., leptos ) to allow users to interact with the bridge.
- **Action:** Implement wallet integrations for **Phantom** and **MetaMask**.
- **Action:** Display balance, transaction status, and history.

#### **Step 5: Test the System**
- **Action:** Test the bridge thoroughly on **Testnets** (e.g., Solana Devnet and Ethereum Rinkeby).
- **Action:** Verify that:
  - Users can lock and mint wSOL.
  - Users can burn wSOL and unlock SOL.
  - The relayer bot correctly handles cross-chain actions.
  
---

### **Security Considerations**
- **Smart Contract Audits:** Ensure that both the **Solana** and **Ethereum** programs are audited for security vulnerabilities (e.g., reentrancy, overflow).
- **Relayer Bot Security:** The bot should only listen to **valid events** and execute transactions with strict checks to prevent double-spending or fraud.

---

### **Next Steps**:
1. **Finalize your Solana program** and deploy it to the testnet.
2. **Develop the Ethereum contract** and deploy it to Rinkeby or another testnet.
3. **Build and deploy the relayer bot**.
4. If needed, **build the frontend interface** for user interaction.
