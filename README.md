# CrossBridge

**Bridging Your SOL to ETH and Beyond**

CrossBridge is a cross-chain bridge that enables token transfers from Solana to Ethereum and other chains. The bridge leverages Merkle proofs on Solana to securely verify transactions before they are released on the destination chain.

## Features

- **SOL â†’ ETH Transfers:** Seamlessly move your Solana tokens to Ethereum.  
- **Merkle Proof on Solana:** Ensures that transactions are securely verified on the Solana blockchain.  
- **Future ZK Integration:** Plans to add zero-knowledge proofs on the destination chain to enhance security and privacy.  
- **Multi-Chain Ready:** Designed with expansion in mind for other blockchain networks.  
- **Developer-Friendly:** APIs and tools in development to integrate CrossBridge into decentralized applications.

## How It Works

1. **Deposit on Solana:** Users lock their tokens on the Solana blockchain.  
2. **Merkle Proof Verification:** The bridge verifies transactions using Merkle proofs to confirm authenticity.  
3. **Release on Destination Chain:** Once verified, the equivalent tokens can be released on Ethereum.  
4. **Monitoring:** Transactions are trackable, giving users visibility into the bridging process.

## Roadmap

- **ZK Proofs on Destination Chain:** Enhance security and privacy for cross-chain transfers.  
- **Support for More Chains:** Expand beyond Solana and Ethereum to include additional blockchain networks.  
- **Developer Tools:** Build robust APIs for easy integration with dApps.
