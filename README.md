# CrossBridge
**Bridging Your SOL to ETH and Beyond**

CrossBridge is a cross-chain bridge enabling secure token transfers from Solana to Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains.

---

## Project Status

### âœ… Version 1.0 (Working Prototype)
We have a **fully functional bridge** where:
- SOL is locked on Solana
- wSOL is minted on the destination chain (Ethereum/Base/etc.)
- Runs on a centralized relayer with a single signer (not multisig)
- **Status:** Live and operational

### ðŸš§ Version 2.0 (Trustless - In Development)
We are building the **next generation trustless bridge** featuring:
- **Merkle Proof Verification:** Proves transaction inclusion in Solana blocks
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** ZK proofs generated via SP1 zkVM
- **Cryptographic Verification:** Destination chain verifier contract validates ZK proofs before minting
- **Decentralized:** No reliance on centralized signers or multisig committees

**Workflow:**

Lock SOL on Solana
â†“
Generate Merkle Proof (transaction in block)
â†“
Pass to SP1 zkVM (generate ZK proof)
â†“
Submit ZK proof to destination chain
â†“
Verifier contract validates proof
â†“
Mint wSOL to user

## Features

### Current (V1)
- **SOL â†’ ETH Transfers:** Seamlessly move Solana tokens to Ethereum
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Track transactions through the bridging process
- **Multi-Chain Ready:** Supports Ethereum, Base, and other EVM chains

### Coming Soon (V2)
- **Trustless Architecture:** Pure cryptographic verification, no trusted intermediaries
- **ZK-Powered Security:** Zero-knowledge proofs ensure transaction validity
- **Merkle Proofs:** Cryptographically prove transactions exist in Solana blocks
- **Developer APIs:** Tools for dApp integration

## How It Works

### Version 1.0 (Current)
1. **Lock SOL:** User locks tokens in Solana contract
2. **Event Detection:** Centralized relayer monitors lock events
3. **verify event with pda state 
4. **Sign & Submit:** Relayer signs transaction and submits to destination
5. **Mint wSOL:** Destination contract mints wrapped tokens

### Version 2.0 (Trustless - In Development)
1. **Lock SOL:** User locks tokens on Solana blockchain
2. **Wait for Finality:** System waits for block finalization (32+ slots)
3. **Generate Merkle Proof:** Build cryptographic proof that transaction exists in block
4. **ZK Proof Generation:** SP1 zkVM wraps Merkle proof in zero-knowledge proof
5. **Submit to Destination:** Relayer (anyone can run) submits ZK proof
6. **Verify & Mint:** Verifier contract validates ZK proof and mints wSOL
